# Django

**Description**

This repository will document all of my efforts in learning the Django framework. Currently I have completed the following tutorials in this order: [The Official Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/), [Youtube User Sentex's Django Web Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNQxxpM1yOs&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeA05ZouE4OzDYLHY-XH-Nd), [Youtube User Thenewboston's Django Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK), and finally [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).

The Django Girls tutorial was the least extensive out of the 4 tutorials that I've done but because of its simplicity I decided to use that tutorial as my first attempt to deploy my first website by using [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python). 

Finally I started reading [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/) to master best practices in utilizing Django! 

**Dependencies**
* Python 3.5
* Django 1.11
