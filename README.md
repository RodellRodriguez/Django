# Django

**Description**

This repository will document all of my efforts in learning the Django framework. Currently I have completed the following tutorials in this order:

1.  [The Official Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)
	* Create a poll for anyone visiting the website to vote on
2. [Youtube User Thenewboston's Django Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK)
	* Create a website called Viberr that allows users to upload information about their music to share with others
3. [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
	* Create a blog

The Django Girls tutorial was the least extensive out of the 3 tutorials that I've done and because of its simplicity I decided to use that tutorial as my first attempt to deploy my first website on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python). 

Finally I started reading [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/) to implement best practices in utilizing Django.

**Dependencies**
* Python 3.5
* Django 1.11
* Heroku
